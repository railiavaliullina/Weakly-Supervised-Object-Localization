# Weakly-Supervised-Object-Localization

## About The Project

1) Implementation of mAP calculation
2) Implementation of process of getting predictions for object localization task:
    
      - boxes prediction based on Class Activarion Maps (CAM), 
      - getting confidences,
      - getting numbers of classes for each picture.
      
3) Getting predictions on COCO2017 validation set
4) Calculating localization accuracy using mAP.
